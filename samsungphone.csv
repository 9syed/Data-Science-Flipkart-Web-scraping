Samsung Galaxy S21 Phantom Violet 256 Gb Reviews: Latest Review of Samsung Galaxy S21 Phantom Violet 256 Gb | Price in India | Flipkart.com,Rigved Naik,"Feb, 2021",504,Brilliant,"Coming from a Oneplus 7, this feels like an amazing phone. It is very compact, sleek and lightweight and rarely fatigues my hand with long time usage. The Dynamic Amoled 2x 120Hz screen has excellent color reproduction and great for media consumption. The camera is very good. I am not a heavy gamer and the phone has no issues with the few games I play. The phone doesnt overheat during charging or continuous operation. With my usage I am getting around 5-6 hours of screen on time which is decent for 4000mAh battery.The only con I can think of is the Exynos 2100 instead of SD 888. Samsung has made some big improvements this time around and based on benchmarks the performance should be between Snapdragon 865+ and Snapgragon 888. But only time will tell how the exynos performs in the long run. Also, there is no MST in Samsung Pay. But this may or may not be a con for you as nowadays people mostly use Gpay or other upi based apps."

Design : Compact design, premium feeling while holding6. Speakers: Awesome Dual Speakers7. Network : Good network reception8. Fingerprint: Fast responseCons:1. Battery: Avg. 4.5-5 hours of screen on time with moderate usage2. Heating: Heats up very quickly even while doing normal stuff like social media and browsing. While using camera the temperature shoots up to 43 degree Celsius for 10 min                     of recording3. Camera: Low light photography is not so good. Too much noiseI am returning this phone for only one reason i.e. heating issue, it completely ruins the overall experience of the phone.
